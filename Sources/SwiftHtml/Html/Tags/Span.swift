/// The `<span>` tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
///
/// The `<span>` tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.
///
/// The `<span>` tag is much like the `<div>` element, but `<div>` is a block-level element and `<span>` is an inline element.
